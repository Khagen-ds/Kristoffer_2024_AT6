The UserInputValidator class works by calling its "validate_positive_integers" method giving it a list.
When the list has been validated, it calls the list_validated method which prints the list with only positive integers.

Example usage:
" ---
test1 = UserInputValidator()
test1.validate_positive_integers(["1", "567", "-32", "-15", "100", "Fredrick", "8.9"])
test1.list_validated()
" ---
